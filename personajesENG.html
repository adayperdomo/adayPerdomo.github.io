            He is a shinobi who serves a young lord descended from an ancient lineage. Bound to his honor, he is a serene and reserved man,
            but also ruthless when it comes to completing his revenge mission by any means necessary.
    
            When Sekiro was a child, he suffered the consequences of a conflict that affected the Japanese population at the end of the Sengoku Era.
            Both he and The Owl survived the battle. The young man scavenged some corpses until he encountered this warrior.
            The Owl lightly passed the edge of his sword across his face, leaving him with a scar that marked him in the same way it did to him.
            The shinobi asked him if he had anyone in his life, and upon deducing that he was orphaned, took him under his wing.
    
            When the story begins, Sekiro loses his life facing the leader of the Ashina Clan, losing the young lord he was supposed to protect.
            During that battle, he also loses his left arm and instead receives a prosthetic that enhances his combat abilities.
            The shinobi code is absolute, guiding him towards his revenge.

    <p id="kuro">
        Kuro is an integral part of the game's plot and the events that unfold during it. He is the only descendant of an ancient and mysterious lineage and,
        like the shinobi, he is alone in the world. He was adopted and raised by the Hirata family. Unlike children his age, he is calm, has a strong heart,
        and gives a natural impression of dignity. Due to his lineage, he is captured by the Commander of the Ashina Clan, with the Wolf failing in his protection.

    <p>Emma</p>
    <img id="ima" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C6I7e3HqmMo/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="">
    <p id="emma">
        Emma is a young healer who offers help to Sekiro in his quest to save his lord. As a disciple of Dogen, Emma is one of the most skilled physicians in Ashina and seems to have connections with several members of the court.
        She can be first seen during the prologue, walking towards the Ashina Reservoir and dropping a letter into the well where Sekiro is.
        Later, she helps the Wolf at her master's behest, although initially, her master's name and intentions are not entirely clear.

    <p id="genichiro">
        Commander Genichiro is the leader of the Ashina Clan. He is the grandson of Isshin Ashina, a legendary swordsman and hero of the north who founded the clan,
        though not by legitimate birth, as he was adopted after his plebeian mother's death. Nevertheless, he has a deep sense of duty towards the clan.
        With his country on the brink of defeat, his people must be protected even through supernatural means; Genichiro studied the "heretical arts"
        and mastered Tomoe's lightning. Genichiro decides to kidnap the young lord to make use of his unusual powers tied to his lineage.
    </p>
    
    <div class="contenedor-linea"><div class="linea"></div></div>
    
    <p>Isshin Ashina</p>
    <img id="ima" src="https://i.blogs.es/ddf33a/ddggdgdg/1366_2000.jpeg" alt="">
    <p id="isshin">
        Isshin Ashina is the founder of the Ashina Clan and the grandfather of Commander Genichiro. He was a kensei, an honorable Japanese warrior known for his mastery with the sword.
        Long ago, he took control of his region in a single generation, founding the clan and earning the title "Hero of the Northern Country." When he was young,
        he fought ceaselessly, honing his technique with enemy blood. He consolidated his teachings into the "Ashina style" to favor his clan's dominance.
        During the events of the game, the founder of the Ashina Clan is shown as an elderly man. He is very tall, with gray hair and very thin,
        often appearing tired as he usually remains in constant rest thanks to Emma, who takes care of him.
