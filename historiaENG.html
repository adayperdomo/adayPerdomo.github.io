        <h1>Plot</h1>
        <p>
            In a reinvented Sengoku period of late 16th century Japan, the warlord Isshin Ashina staged a bloody coup and took control of the land of Ashina from the Interior Ministry. During this time, a wandering shinobi named Ukonzaemon Usui, known by many as Owl, adopted a nameless orphan boy, whom he named Wolf, and trained him in the ways of the shinobi.
            <br>
            <br>
            Two decades later, the Ashina clan is on the brink of collapse due to Isshin now being old and sick and enemies of the clan constantly approaching from all sides. Desperate to save his clan, Isshin's grandson, Genichiro, sought out Kuro, the Divine Heir, to use the boy's "Dragon's Heritage" to create an immortal army. Wolf, now a fully-fledged shinobi and Kuro's personal bodyguard, loses his left arm while failing to stop Genichiro. However, having received Kuro's dragon blood three years earlier, Wolf survives his wounds and wakes up in an abandoned temple. In the temple, he meets the Sculptor, a former shinobi named Orangutan who now carves Buddha statues, and Wolf finds his lost arm has been replaced with the Shinobi Prosthetic, a sophisticated artificial arm that can wield a variety of gadgets and weapons.

            <br>
            With the Shinobi Prosthetic, Wolf assaults Ashina Castle and faces Genichiro again, defeating him, although the latter is able to escape due to having drunk the Rejuvenating Waters, a man-made replica of the dragon's blood. Despite having the opportunity to flee Ashina forever, Kuro decides to stay and perform the ritual of "Immortal Severance," which would remove his dragon heritage and prevent further battles for immortality. Wolf reluctantly agrees to help Kuro and sets out to the areas surrounding the castle to collect all the necessary components for the ritual, including a special sword that can kill immortals known as the Mortal Blade. When Wolf returns, he encounters Owl, who was thought to have been killed three years ago. Owl reveals that he also seeks Kuro's Dragon Heritage and orders Wolf to renounce his loyalty to Kuro.
            <br>
            <br>
            Wolf is presented with the choice to follow Owl and betray Kuro or remain loyal to Kuro. If Wolf sides with Owl, he is forced to fight Emma, a doctor serving Isshin, and Isshin himself. After defeating them, Wolf then stabs Owl in the back as Kuro watches in horror, realizing that Wolf has been corrupted by bloodlust and has fallen down the path of Shura. It is then stated that a demon roamed the land for many years, killing many people.
            <br>
            <br>
            If Kuro is chosen, Wolf fights and kills Owl. He then uses the items he has gathered to enter the Fountainhead Palace. There, Wolf enters the Divine Realm, where he battles the Divine Dragon to obtain its tears for the Immortal Severance. Returning to Ashina Castle, Wolf discovers it has been attacked by the Interior Ministry and that Isshin has succumbed to his illness and died, and Emma informs him that Kuro has fled through a secret passage. Wolf finds Kuro and Genichiro wounded, wielding a second Mortal Blade. Genichiro then challenges Wolf one last time. Upon his defeat, he sacrifices himself to bring Isshin to life at the height of his power. Although Isshin sides with Wolf and Kuro, he honors Genichiro's sacrifice and chooses to fight Wolf.

            <br>
            After defeating Isshin, the player can obtain three endings depending on what is given to Kuro. The standard ending is "Immortal Severance." Wolf gives Kuro the dragon tears and cuts his ties with the Divine Dragon. This process ends up killing Kuro, while Wolf becomes the next Sculptor and ends his life as a shinobi. In the "Purification" ending, Wolf manages to save Kuro at the cost of his own life. The secret and true ending, "Return," is obtained by helping the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters complete a ritual to return the Divine Dragon's power to its birthplace in the West. Kuro's spirit is transferred to the Divine Child's heart. Wolf remains a shinobi and chooses to travel with the Divine Child on her journey to the west.
